#Self Assessment - Block 1

1. **What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)**

I am still having trouble with flexbox, and dom manipulation. Getting the correct data from the API to populate in both galvanize personal and the galvanize eats. Habits I need improve on is doing more work at home. 


2. **Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above.** *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*

Some goals I want to set this week is finish galvanize eats, and the AJAX checkpoint, as well as finish at least 3-4 accumilator problems a day which should put me close to being caught up in q1. 


3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**

A few aha moments I've had, is 1 in pixel-art-maker when I was able to event.target.style.backgroundColor was able to give me the background color of a div after I clicked it was a huge moment. As I practice accumilator patterns more and more my understanding of loops is greatly improving. Finally creating loops that go through json.response to populate specified divs was a satisying feeling. 





4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**

I feel most confident in itterations and conditionals.
Completing pixel-art maker felt like a big milestone, and hopefully completing galvanize eats will brings the same satisfaction. 



5. **What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?**

I am excited to see if 3d printing becomes more mainstream and affordable.
